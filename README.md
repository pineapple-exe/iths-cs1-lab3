## Interpreting Metadata from BMP & PNG

A console application that takes a path as an argument, then reads the binary data and tells the user if the file is of the format BMP, PNG or neither,
as well as prints the resolution data of the image.

If it's a .png-file, the program also lists all chunks (type and size) in accordance with their original order of occurrences.
